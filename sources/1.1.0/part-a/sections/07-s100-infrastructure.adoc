== IHO S-100 infrastructure

This section describes IHO Infrastructure that has been developed to support the
S-100 framework and the e-Navigation concept.

=== IHO Geospatial Infrastructure (GI) Registry

A Registry is the entire information system (or location) in which a collection of
Registers is located. A Register is a collection of tables in a database containing
identifiers assigned to items with descriptions of the associated items.
Descriptions may consist of many types of information including names, definitions
and codes.

In the case of S-100, the IHO is hosting an online Registry engine called S-100
Geospatial Information (GI) Registry. The IHO GI Registry can be accessed at
http://registry.iho.int/[http://registry.iho.int]. This Registry provides the
facility to access and maintain the various S-100 Registers. The S-100 GI Registry
contains subordinate Registers, depicted in <<fig-A-7-1>> below.

Each Register type can be further sub-divided into Domains (for example,
Hydrographic, Inland ENC, AtoN, etc). The administration of the IHO GI Registry is
governed by the IHO Publication S-99 -- Operational Procedures for the Organization
and Management of the S-100 Geospatial Information Registry.

A major benefit of the Registry and Register concept is its flexibility, which
allows multiple versions of similar entries in the Concept Register using unique
identification and classification. An entry is classified as being either:

* valid (latest version);
* superseded (previous versions);
* retired (no longer recommended for use); or
* not valid (proposed but not accepted or no longer acceptable).

Due to this classification and time stamps, a version of a Feature Catalogue
references items that will always be legitimate even if a newer version of the
referenced item is registered at a later date. This means that if a new item is
registered or an existing item is amended, a new version of a Product Specification
is not automatically required as a consequence. The category of "not valid" items is
included in the Registers specifically to help identify the inappropriate
reintroduction of previously rejected proposals.

=== Feature Catalogue Builder

A Feature Catalogue is a machine-readable expression of the data model for a Product
Specification. It can either be constructed with off-the-shelf XML editors or by a
Feature Catalogue Builder (FCB). Either case must comply with the structure of
<<S100,part=5>> and the S-100 Feature Catalogue Schema. There is a FCB available
from IHO for anyone wishing to utilize it in the creation of a Feature Catalogue for
an S-100-based Product Specification. The software interacts with the IHO GI
Registry and provides a mechanism for binding elements available in the Registry
together to form features and attributes; enumerated lists with their available
values; and so forth. <<fig-A-7-2>> below illustrates the concept of the IHO FCB.

The FCB also contains a function for working with proposals that have yet to be
added to the Registry.

=== DCEG Builder

To simplify the creation of the Data Classification and Encoding Guide (DCEG) for a
Product Specification, a DCEG Builder has been created. This tool utilizes the
Feature Catalogue to create the bindings and inputs for the DCEG tables. It is then
a manual process to add images and specific text to the encoding part of the DCEG
tables. <<fig-A-7-3>> below shows a high-level overview of the process to create a
DCEG via the DCEG Builder. An Application Schema is required to make the Feature
Catalogue, which equates to an XML representation of the Application Schema. The use
of the Feature Catalogue can be described in the DCEG.

Use of the DCEG Builder is optional in the preparation of the Product Specification.
Any S-100-based Product Specification must include sufficient instructions for how
to encode information in a manner that conforms to the Specification, but these
instructions do not have to follow a specific DCEG style. However, the DCEG style is
simple to understand and by utilizing the DCEG builder, it is also easy to create
tables{blank}footnote:[A suggested format for such tables is described in the IHO
S-100 Production Specification Template, which is referenced in
<<S100,part=11,locality:appendix="11-D">> and available from the IHO web site.] of
feature and information types, attributes, associations and encoding instructions;
and to ensure that these tables are consistent with the Feature Catalogue. The
IHO-style feature tables (or equivalent) can be prepared and maintained using
ordinary office word processing software, but experience shows that ensuring initial
and continued conformance to the XML Feature Catalogue may be a significant task
requiring much effort to maintain and keep current. <<fig-A-7-4>> below shows how
the DCEG Builder is connected to the IHO GI Registry; and shows how the DCEG Builder
is integrated in the process of creating a Feature Catalogue. Using the Builder can
greatly simplify the development process and increase consistency with the Feature
Catalogue. It should be noted that the DCEG Builder is dependent on the Feature
Catalogue being registered within the Feature Catalogue Database.

=== Portrayal Catalogue Builder

Portrayal Catalogues are machine-readable instructions for how to portray data
compliant with a specific data model for a specific version of a Product
Specification. They can either be constructed manually or by a Portrayal Catalogue
Builder (PCB). In either case, they must comply with the structure specified in
<<S100,part=9>> and the S-100 Portrayal Catalogue Schema. The IHO infrastructure
includes a PCB for XSLT for any Product Specification development team wishing to
utilize it in the creation of a Portrayal Catalogue for an S-100-based Product
Specification.

[[fig-A-7-5]]

The software interacts with the Portrayal Register in the IHO GI Registry and the
Feature Catalogue and provides an interface for binding elements available in the
IHO GI Registry together to form symbols, line styles and area patterns for the
desired elements in the Feature Catalogue. <<fig-A-7-5>> above illustrates the PCB
concept.

A PCB for Lua Portrayal Catalogues is planned for the future.
