== Data Classification and Encoding Guide

The Data Classification and Encoding Guide (DCEG) provides information on how the
data is to be captured. This should be as detailed and specific as necessary. The
DCEG is used primarily by cartographers, editors, and data encoders, rather than
application developers or OEMs; and should be written from that perspective.

The DCEG includes the collection criteria for mapping real world objects to the
conceptual objects of the dataset.

Any organization performing data capture for the data product defined by the Product
Specification must provide references to any more detailed encoding guide used in
addition to that indicated in the Product Specification for the capturing process.
