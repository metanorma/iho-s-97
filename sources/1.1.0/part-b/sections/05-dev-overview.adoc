== Overview of steps for development

When developing an S-100 based Product Specification it is recommended that
developers consider each of the stages defined in the basic development process. The
stages are outlined below and described in greater detail in the following sections.

[[cls-B-5.1]]
=== Basic development process

The steps described below apply to the development of a Product Specification for a
new data product.

. *Initiation*. Identify the need for a new data product; define its scope; and
decide the boundaries between the new product and existing data Product
Specifications. Obtain sample source material. Describe typical application use
cases.
. *Develop the Domain Model/Application Schema*. Define the classes and attributes
that describe the domain and which are relevant to the data product. Define the
relationships between the classes and specify applicable constraints. Prepare one or
more UML diagrams describing the Domain Model.
. *Populate the IHO GI Registry from the Domain Model*. Propose amendments to
existing classes and attributes and propose new classes and attributes for addition
to the Concept and Data Dictionary Registers in the IHO GI Registry using the
Registry interface. Follow up on any returned proposals or queries from the Registry
Manager or Domain Control Body.
. *Develop the Feature Catalogue*. Prepare the XML Feature Catalogue from the
feature and information classes, attributes and relationships as approved in the IHO
GI Registry, utilizing the Feature Catalogue Builder.
. *Define data transfer modes and packaging*. Determine whether data products are to
be delivered as data files contained in transfer (exchange) sets, by web services
(and if so, identify or outline a service protocol), e-mail, etc. Determine whether data is to be delivered in real or near real-time. Identify constraints and
requirements arising from delivery mechanisms and communication constraints such as
message size, bandwidth limitations, availability of communications to customers,
licensing and payments, encryption, etc.
. *Define metadata*. Survey the metadata elements listed in S-100 for their
appropriateness to the data product and its allowed packaging and delivery methods.
Define appropriate values and restrictions for the metadata elements listed in
S-100. Consider whether additional product-specific metadata elements are needed.
. *Define the data format*. Select an appropriate data format. S-100 provides for 3
standard delivery formats (ISO 8211, GML, and HDF5). Define format-imposed items
(for example embedded header metadata). Prepare format-specific artefacts if
necessary (for example GML "application schema" XSD files for the GML format).
. *Develop the Data Classification and Encoding Guide (DCEG)*. The DCEG is intended
for cartographers, editors, and data encoders, rather than application developers or
OEMs; and should be written from that perspective. A DCEG should contain enough
overview and general material about basic concepts such as data types, features,
information types, associations, etc, to give its intended audience a basic
grounding in the concepts they will need to apply; but its main focus should be on
what to encode in the data product, and how to encode it.
. *Define portrayal symbols and rules*. Determine the symbols to be used for
portrayal and the rules for generating displays from the data product. This means
deciding which features should be displayed; which combinations of attribute values
or associated data objects should be assigned distinct symbols; and which
pre-existing symbols and colours can be reused and which need to be defined. It also
includes defining the new elements in the appropriate formats.
. *Registration of portrayal elements*. Propose any new portrayal components (for
example symbols, colour tokens, line styles, area fills, etc) to the Portrayal
Register in the IHO GI Registry using the Registry interface. Follow up on any
returned proposals or queries from the Registry Manager or Domain Control Body.
. *Develop the Portrayal Catalogue(s).* Prepare a Portrayal Catalogue (or
Catalogues) for the features and information types which are intended to be
displayed in the intended application domain(s) and usage scenario(s). This consists
of encoding the rules in the appropriate portrayal language using the symbols
determined in step (8).
. *Define the spatial reference system*. Identify the recommended coordinate
reference system and vertical datum(s).
. *Define data product packaging and maintenance*. Define the content and structure
of delivery packages, updating of data, and any auxiliary content delivered either
with or as an adjunct to data.
. *Define validation checks and quality measures*. Define tests for the spatial,
structural, and conceptual integrity of datasets. Define format-specific
implementations of validation checks (for example Schematron rules <<ISO19757-3>> for
the GML format). Define quality measures for the datasets (quality measures will
generally be statistics about passed and failed tests).
. *Determine interoperability* with other data products. Determine which if any
product groups in Interoperability Catalogues are supplemented or enhanced by the
data product; and how the IHO Interoperability Catalogue will be affected by the new
product, including updates to display priorities, interleaving, predefined
combinations and other interoperability rules and operations.
. *Prepare sample data* for test-beds. Create sample datasets and exchange sets
conforming to the data format, packaging, and Feature Catalogue defined in the
Product Specification.
. *Testing and feedback*. Carry out tests of data production and use of the sample
data in selected applications to validate the correctness, completeness,
consistency, and utility of the Product Specification, including related artefacts
such as the Feature Catalogue and XML schemas.

Development of Product Specifications is an iterative process of continuous
refinement as it moves through the S-100 Readiness Levels. Developers should expect
to cycle through the stages above multiple times, in smaller or larger cycles
depending on experiences and results of each stage. For example, the first
preparation of sample data (Stage 16) might identify gaps in the Domain Model and
require revisiting Stage 2 (development of the Domain Model); or the development of
portrayal rules (Stages 9 - 11) may identify gaps in the Domain Model (Stage 2).
Passage through some intermediate stages in the cycle may be trivial on the second
and later passes, as the results may be unaffected by discoveries during later
stages in the process -- for example, packaging and delivery or choice of spatial
reference systems are likely to be unaffected by changes identified during the
preparation of sample data.

<<fig-B-5-1>> below depicts the development process, including probable cycles.

developing a domain model plus related registry actions. The figure also includes
black-box stages for "Coordinate Reference System" and "Product Specification
Documentation" at the end of the process. The actual process is an iterative
refinement process.

=== Review cycle for S-100-based Product Specifications

IHO Resolution 2/2007 (as amended) outlines the process for development and approval
of IHO based Product Specifications. As part of this lifecycle it is important that
Working Groups and Project Teams engage with the IHO Data Quality Working Group
(DQWG) to review Product Specifications for adherence to S-100 data quality aspects
and completeness. While this review can occur prior to Edition 1.0.0 (Testing and
Implementation Edition), the DQWG will review and provide feedback during the
Edition 1.0.0 to 1.9.n phase Specification development. Edition 1.0.0 of any IHO
S-100-based Product Specification is not designed for regular use in approved
arrangements or for provision of operation services by purpose. Edition 2.0.0 of a
Product Specification is considered to be mature and can be used for implementation.
<<fig-B-5-2>> below shows the IHO Review Cycle as included in IHO Resolution 2/2007.

=== Process for extending a Specification

If there is a demonstrated need to extend an existing Product Specification,
developers should review the steps in the basic process in <<cls-B-5.1>> and
determine which steps can be omitted.

For example, if features, information types, attributes, or relationships are added,
removed, or modified, most of the steps in the basic process will be needed. The
spatial reference system and packaging/maintenance may not change in such a revision
and the corresponding phases can be skipped.

If the extension consists of defining a new transfer mode, such as adding a
streaming delivery mode for data products originally intended for exchange set
delivery, it is likely that only the following stages need be executed:

* Transfer mode -- to add the streaming mode for transfer, define specifications for
servers, etc.
* Metadata -- to define which metadata elements in the exchange set mode apply to the
streaming mode, whether any new metadata elements are needed, and how metadata is
delivered or made available in the new mode.
* Data format -- to consider whether the already defined data format is appropriate
for streamed transfer and compatible with the intended service delivery and
protocols; and specify an appropriate format if necessary.
* Packaging and maintenance -- to specify the appropriate data wrapper formats and
service protocols; for example WFS, REST, etc. Defining new wrapper formats or
protocols is permitted but should be the last resort.
* Sample data -- preparation of sample data for testing the streaming mode.
* Testing and feedback -- this should include a prototype or simulated streamed data
transfer environment.
