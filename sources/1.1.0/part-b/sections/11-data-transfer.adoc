== Data transfer modes and packaging

Define mode of delivery -- exchange set, message, or service. A Product Specification
may also specify more than one delivery mode.

This needs to be done before metadata is specified because some metadata elements as
well as the treatment of metadata (for example separate versus embedded) depend on
delivery mechanisms, constraints, and protocols.

Details of packaging and transfer content can be finalized in a later stage (see
<<cls-B-18>>).
