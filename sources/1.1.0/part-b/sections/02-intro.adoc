== Introduction

The intent of Part B is to explain the various components of a Product Specification
for those that are developing S-100 based Product Specifications. It describes the
typical phases of development for the typical Product Specification; and a
prescribed order for each phase. It provides guidance on how the rules contained in
S-100 are used to build the components of a Product Specification, including
documentation components; UML models; and machine-readable components such as XML
Feature Catalogues and data formats.
