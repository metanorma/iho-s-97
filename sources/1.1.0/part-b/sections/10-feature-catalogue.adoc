== Feature Catalogue

The Feature Catalogue is an XML document which conforms to the S-100 XML Feature
Catalogue Schema. Note, for Imagery and Gridded Data, a coverage is a feature type;
and a Product Specification Feature Catalogue should define the attributes, coverage
feature (with spatial primitive type 'coverage').

Feature Catalogues should be documented by a text-based documentation of their
contents, which should also be reviewed by the Project Team and responsible Working
Group. For review purposes, this text-based documentation should be generated from
the XML Feature Catalogue. The resultant text can be in Word or PDF; or another
format preferred by the team.
