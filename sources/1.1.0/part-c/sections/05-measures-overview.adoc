== Overview of data quality measures

The relations between data quality terms are presented in <<fig-C-5-1>> below. The
terms have been defined in <<cls-C-4.1>>.

The components of Data Quality Measure can be divided into the following
elements{blank}footnote:[<<ISO19157,page=7>>.]:

. Completeness
. Logical Consistency
. Positional Accuracy
. Thematic Accuracy
. Temporal Quality
. Aggregation
. Usability

Data Quality Evaluation can be divided into the following elements:

. Data Quality Full Inspection
. Data Quality Sample Based Inspection
. Data Quality Indirect Evaluation
. Data Quality Aggregation Derivation

Data Quality Result can be divided into the following elements:

. Data Quality Conformance Result
. Data Quality Quantitative Result
. Data Quality Descriptive Result

=== Data quality measures

The description of data quality measures in this section is quoted from <<ISO19157>>.

*Completeness* is defined as the presence and absence of features, their attributes
and relationships. It consists of two Data Quality Elements:

* Commission -- excess data present in a dataset;
* Omission -- data absent from a dataset.

*Logical Consistency* is defined as the degree of adherence to logical rules of data
structure, attribution and relationships (data structure can be conceptual, logical
or physical). If these logical rules are documented elsewhere (for example in a
Product Specification) then the source should be referenced (for example in the data
quality evaluation). It consists of four Data Quality Elements:

* Conceptual consistency -- adherence to rules of the conceptual schema;
* Domain consistency -- adherence of values to the value domains;
* Format consistency -- degree to which data is stored in accordance with the
physical structure of the dataset;
* Topological consistency -- correctness of the explicitly encoded topological
characteristics of a dataset.

*Positional Accuracy* is defined as the accuracy of the position of features within
a spatial reference system. It consists of three Data Quality Elements:

* Absolute or external accuracy -- closeness of reported coordinate values to values
accepted as or being true;
* Relative or internal accuracy -- closeness of the relative positions of features in
a dataset to their respective relative positions accepted as or being true;
* Gridded data positional accuracy -- closeness of gridded data spatial position
values to values accepted as or being true.

*Thematic Accuracy* is defined as the accuracy of quantitative attributes and the
correctness of non-quantitative attributes and of the classifications of features
and their relationships. It consists of three Data Quality Elements:

* Classification correctness -- comparison of the classes assigned to features or
their attributes to a Universe of Discourse (for example ground truth or reference
data);
* Non-quantitative attribute correctness -- measure of whether a non-quantitative
attribute is correct or incorrect;
* Quantitative attribute accuracy -- closeness of the value of a quantitative
attribute to a value accepted as or known to be true.

*Temporal Quality* is defined as the quality of the temporal attributes and temporal
relationships of features. It consists of three Data Quality Elements:

* Accuracy of a time measurement -- closeness of reported time measurements to values
accepted as or known to be true;
* Temporal consistency -- correctness of the order of events;
* Temporal validity -- validity of data with respect to time.

*Usability* is based on user requirements. All quality elements may be used to
evaluate usability. Usability evaluation may be based on specific user requirements
that cannot be described using the quality elements described above. In this case,
the usability element must be used to describe specific quality information about a
dataset's suitability for a particular application or conformance to a set of
requirements.
