== Recommendations for Product Specification developers

S-97 Part C applies the Data Quality concept from <<ISO19157>> to the development
of S-100 based Product Specifications. It provides ten recommendations which assist
in finding and applying applicable Data Quality Measures as described in S-100.

=== Completeness > Commission / Omission

DQ_CompletenessCommission: Defined in
<<S100,locality:appendix="4c-C">>.

DQ_CompletenessOmission: Defined in
<<S100,locality:appendix="4c-C">>.

[recommendation]
====
Data Quality Measure Completeness (Commission/Omission) to be included in the
Product Specification.
====

=== Logical Consistency > Conceptual Consistency

The Conceptual Schema Language is described in <<S100,part=1>>. It provides the description of:

* classes;
* attributes;
* basic data types;
* primitive types;
* complex types;
* predefined derived types;
* enumerated types;
* codelist types;
* relationships and associations;
* composition and aggregation;
* stereotypes and optional, conditional, and mandatory attributes and associations;
* naming and name spaces;
* notes; and
* packages.

[recommendation]
====
Data Quality Measure Conceptual Consistency to follow the guidelines from
<<S100,part=1>> and to be included in the Product Specification.
====

=== Logical Consistency > Domain Consistency

This is described in <<S100,part=5>>. This Part provides a
standard framework for organizing and reporting the classification of real world
phenomena in a set of geographic data. It defines the methodology for classification
of the feature types and specifies how they are organized in a Feature Catalogue and
presented to the users of a set of geographic data. This methodology is applicable
to creating catalogues of feature types in previously uncatalogued domains and to
revising existing Feature Catalogues to comply with standard practice. It applies to
the cataloguing of feature types that are represented in digital form. Its
principles can be extended to the cataloguing of other forms of geographic data.

[recommendation]
====
Data Quality Measure Domain Consistency to follow the guidelines from
<<S100,part=5>> and to be included in the Product Specification.
====

=== Logical Consistency > Format Consistency

This is described in <<S100,part=10>>. S-100 does not
mandate particular encoding formats so it is left to developers of Product
Specifications to decide on suitable encoding standards and to document their chosen
format. The issue of encoding information is complicated by the range of encoding
standards that are available, which include but are not limited to: ISO/IEC8211,
GML, XML, GeoTiff, HDF-5, JPEG2000.

[recommendation]
====
Data Quality Measure Format Consistency to follow the guidelines from
<<S100,part=10>> and to be included in the Product Specification.
====

=== Logical Consistency > Topological Consistency

This is described in <<S100,part=7>>. It supports 0, 1, 2, and 2.5 dimensional
spatial schemas and two levels of complexity -- geometric primitives and geometric
complexes.

The conditions for topological consistency are provided in
<<S100,part=7,clause="7-4.3">> and <<S100,locality:appendix="7-A">>. The Figures in
<<S100,part=7,clause="7-4.3">> and <<S100,locality:appendix="7-A">> should be
referred to for more details.

[recommendation]
====
Data Quality Measure Topological Consistency to follow the guidelines from
<<S100,part=7>> and to be included in the Product Specification.

=== Positional Accuracy

Positional Accuracyis described by <<S100,part="4c">>.

This is further subdivided into Absolute or External Accuracy, Vertical Position
Accuracy, Horizontal Positional Accuracy, Gridded Data Position Accuracy.

One should take notice of the different ways in which spatial data referencing is
applied. Point set data includes a coordinate direct position for each point in the
point set (points/curves). Gridded data references the grid as a whole. The two
spatial properties of gridded data describe how the spatial extent was tessellated
into small units and spatial referencing to the earth. The <<ISO19123>> Standard
indicates that a grid may be defined in terms of a coordinate reference system. This
requires additional information about the location of the grid's origin within the
coordinate reference system; the orientation of the grid axes; and a measure of the
spacing between the grid lines. A grid defined in this way is called a rectified
grid. If the coordinate reference system is related to the Earth by a datum, the
grid is a georectified grid. The essential point is that the transformation of grid
coordinates to coordinates of the external coordinate reference system is an affine
transformation.

For Positional Accuracy, currently in the hydrographic community the 95% confidence
level (Gaussian distribution) is commonly used. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is
commonly used in the scientific community. RMSE is the square root of the average of
the set of squared differences between dataset coordinate values and coordinate
values from an independent source of higher accuracy for identical points.

Other calculation methods are also possible, depending on the specific Product
Specification. Comparisons of S-44, S-101, S-102, and S-121 were done. They use
various methods of calculating and/or expressing the same concept (uncertainty).
Some of the methods in use are:

* S-44: 95% (2*SD)
* S-121: Standard Circular Error (=0.7071*SQRT(SD(X)+SD(Y))), converted to a
category attribute.
* S-101: All horizontal positional (2D), vertical (1D), horizontal distance (1D) and
orientation (1D) uncertainty attributes concern the 95% confidence level of the
variation associated with all sources of measurement, processing and visualization
error. Uncertainty is encoded as: (1) uncertainty fixed (The maximum absolute value
of the one-dimensional error (for vertical) or two-dimensional error (for
horizontal). The error is assumed to be positive and negative.) and (2) uncertainty
variable factor (The factor to be applied to a quantity to calculate its
uncertainty. The fraction that equates to the factor (or percentage) contributing to
the variable uncertainty component is indicated, that is a factor of 5% is encoded
as 0.05.)

The situation above is like using nautical miles, imperial miles, and kilometers
separately between different Product Specifications -- which may work well in
isolation, but when combining the different Product Specifications and use computer
algorithms to create a "smart" system based on these quality parameters, great care
must be taken in developing systems to ensure confusion is not introduced.

The IHO DQWG is considering different approaches to addressing this situation, and
may leave the separate Product Specifications with their own parameters but inform
developers and other users of the Specifications how to convert from one accuracy
standard to another.

[recommendation]
====
Data Quality Measure Positional Accuracy to follow the guidelines from
<<S100,part="4c">> and to be included in the Product Specification. The calculation
of the Positional Accuracy is to be further harmonized where possible with other
S-100 based Product Specifications.
====

=== Thematic Accuracy

Thematic Accuracyis described in <<ISO19157>>.

This is further subdivided into: Quantitative Attribute Accuracy; Non-quantitative
Attribute Accuracy; and Thematic Classification Correctness.

The data content of a geographic application is defined in accordance with a view of
real world features and in the context of the requirements of a particular
application. The content is structured in terms of objects. This document considers
two types of object:

. Features -- features are defined together with their properties.
. Information Types -- information types are used to share information among features
and other information types. Information types have only thematic attribute
properties.

For Thematic Classification Correctness, the assignment of an item to a certain
class can either be correct or incorrect.

For Quantitative Attribute Accuracy, the accuracy of quantitative attributes can be
measured in terms of uncertainty intervals.

For Non-quantitative Attribute Accuracy, the attribute values of non-quantitative
attributes can be correct or incorrect.

[recommendation]
====
Data Quality Measure Thematic Accuracy to follow the guidelines from
<<S100,part="4c">> and to be included in the Product Specification.
====

=== Temporal Quality

Temporal Quality is described by <<S100,part="4c">>.

Temporal Consistency and Temporal Validity are recommended to be included as this
provides the user with the guarantee that any information in the temporal-spatial
domain is registered correctly. For data elements with a very precise temporal
attribute (for example remote sensing), the temporal accuracy may also be provided.

[recommendation]
====
Data Quality Measure Temporal Quality to follow the guidelines from
<<S100,part="4c">> and to be included in the Product Specification. Temporal
Consistency and Temporal Validity should be included.
====

=== Aggregation

Data Quality specified at upper level (for example series) is applicable at lower
level (for example dataset), see <<table-C-6-1>> (quoted from <<ISO19157>>) below. If
the Data Quality differs between the upper and lower level, then supplemental
information should be provided at the lower level.

[[table-C-6-1]]

|===
.5+a| [%unnumbered]

2+| Series
2+| Dataset
2+| Subset
| Feature type | Attribute type
| Feature instance | Attribute instance
|===

In the case of aggregation of different quality results, the standalone quality
report should provide full information on the original results (with evaluation
procedures and measures applied); the aggregated result; and the aggregation method,
whereas the metadata may describe only the aggregated result with a reference to the
original results described in the standalone quality report.

The aggregated Data Quality result provides a result if the dataset has passed
conformance to the Data Product Specification.

[recommendation]
====
Data Quality Measure Aggregation results should be included to indicate if the
dataset/dataset series have passed the Product Specifications.
====

=== Usability

Usability is based on user requirements. All quality elements may be used to
evaluate usability. Usability evaluation may be based on specific user requirements
that cannot be described using the quality elements described above. In this case,
the usability element shall be used to describe specific quality information about a
dataset's suitability for a particular application or conformance to a set of
requirements.

All Product Specifications should have a paragraph describing Data Quality. To
ensure harmonization across different Product Specifications, DQWG recommends that
all Product Specifications share a common text explaining the concept of Data
Quality -> Introduction to Data Quality. The text below is a proposal for this
common introduction:

____
*Introduction to data quality*

Data quality allows users and user systems to assess fitness for use of the provided
data. Data quality measures and the associated evaluation are reported as metadata
of a data product. This metadata improves interoperability with other data products
and provides usage by user groups that the data product was not originally intended
for. The secondary users can make assessments of the data product usefulness in
their application based on the reported data quality measures.

For < this Product Specification > the following Data Quality Elements have been
included{blank}footnote:[As deemed necessary by the IHO -- Hydrographic Standards and
Services Committee]:

* Conformance to this Product Specification;
* Intended purpose of the data product;
* Completeness of the data product in terms of coverage;
* Logical Consistency;
* Positional Uncertainty and Accuracy;
* Thematic Accuracy;
* Temporal Quality;
* Aggregation measures;
* Validation checks or conformance checks including:
** General tests for dataset integrity;
** Specific tests for a specific data model.
