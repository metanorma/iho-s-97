== Data quality measures

This list is derived from <<ISO19157>>.

There are twenty different data quality measures defined that can be used for
validation of S-100 based Product Specifications. These are shown in <<table-C-7-1>>
below. There is a recommendation following the table for the target result of
Positional Accuracy for depth contour lines and gridded bathymetry.

The full list of <<ISO19157>> measures applicable to S-100-based Product Specifications
is available in
<<S100,locality:appendix="4c-C">>.

| Data Quality Measure | Definition | DQ measure / description | Evaluation scope | Applicable to spatial representation types

| Completeness / Commission | Excess data present in a dataset, as described by the scope. | numberOfExcessItems / This data quality measure indicates the number of items in the dataset, that should not have been present in the dataset. | dataset/dataset series | All S-100 based PS

| Completeness / Commission | Excess data present in a dataset, as described by the scope. | numberOfDuplicateFeatureInstances / This data quality measure indicates the total number of exact duplications of feature instances within the data. | dataset/dataset series | All S-100 based PS

| Completeness / Omission | Data absent from the dataset, as described by the scope. | numberOfMissingItems / This data quality measure is an indicator that shows that a specific item is missing in the data. | dataset/dataset series/spatial object type | All S-100 based PS

| Logical Consistency / Conceptual Consistency | Adherence to the rules of a conceptual schema. | numberOfInvalidSurfaceOverlaps / This data quality measure is a count of the total number of erroneous overlaps within the data. Which surfaces may overlap and which must not is application dependent. Not all overlapping surfaces are necessarily erroneous. | spatial object / spatial object type | PS with geometric surfaces.

| Logical Consistency / Domain Consistency | Adherence of the values to the value domains. | numberOfNonconformantItems / This data quality measure is a count of all items in the dataset that are not in conformance with their value domain. | spatial object / spatial object type | All S-100 based PS

| Logical Consistency / Format Consistency | Degree to which data is stored in accordance with the physical structure of the data set, as described by the scope | physicalStructureConflictsNumber / This data quality measure is a count of all items in the dataset that are stored in conflict with the physical structure of the dataset. | dataset/dataset series | All S-100 based PS

| Logical Consistency / Topological Consistency | Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the dataset, as described by the scope. | rateOfFaultyPointCurveConnections / This data quality measure indicates the number of faulty link-node connections in relation to the number of supposed link-node connections. This data quality measure gives the erroneous point-curve connections in relation to the total number of point-curve connections. | spatial object / spatial object type | PS with curves.

| Logical Consistency / Topological Consistency | Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the dataset, as described by the scope. | numberOfMissingConnectionsUndershoots / This data quality measure is a count of items in the dataset within the parameter tolerance that are mismatched due to undershoots. | spatial object / spatial object type | PS with curves.

| Logical Consistency / Topological Consistency | Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the dataset, as described by the scope. | numberOfMissingConnectionsOvershoots / This data quality measure is a count of items in the dataset within the parameter tolerance that are mismatched due to overshoots. | spatial object / spatial object type | PS with curves.

| Logical Consistency / Topological Consistency | Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the dataset, as described by the scope. | numberOfInvalidSlivers / This data quality measure is a count of all items in the dataset that are invalid sliver surfaces. A sliver is an unintended area that occurs when adjacent surfaces are not digitized properly. The borders of the adjacent surfaces may unintentionally gap or overlap to cause a topological error. | dataset / dataset series | PS with geometric surfaces.

| Logical Consistency / Topological Consistency | Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the dataset, as described by the scope. | numberOfInvalidSelfIntersects / This data quality measure is a count of all items in the dataset that illegally intersect with themselves. | spatial object / spatial object type | PS with curves / geometric surfaces.

| Logical Consistency / Topological Consistency | Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the dataset, as described by the scope. | numberOfInvalidSelfOverlap / This data quality measure is a count of all items in the dataset that illegally self-overlap. | spatial object / spatial object type | PS with curves / geometric surfaces.

| Positional Accuracy / Absolute or External Accuracy | Closeness of reported coordinative values to values accepted as or being true. | Root Mean Square Error / Standard deviation, where the true value is not estimated from the observations but known a priori. | spatial object / spatial object type | PS with objects that have coordinative values associated.

| Positional Accuracy / Vertical Position Accuracy | Closeness of reported coordinative values to values accepted as or being true. | linearMapAccuracy2Sigma / Half length of the interval defined by an upper and lower limit in which the true value lies with probability 95%. | spatial object / spatial object type | PS with objects that have a vertical coordinative values associated.

| Positional Accuracy / Horizontal Position Accuracy | Closeness of reported coordinative values to values accepted as or being true. | linearMapAccuracy2Sigma / Half length of the interval defined by an upper and lower limit in which the true value lies with probability 95%. | spatial object / spatial object type | PS with objects that have a horizontal coordinative values associated.

| Positional Accuracy / Gridded Data Position Accuracy | Closeness of reported coordinative values to values accepted as or being true. | Root mean square error of planimetry / Radius of a circle around the given point, in which the true value lies with probability P. | spatial object / spatial object type | PS with objects that have a gridded coordinative values associated.

| Temporal Quality / Temporal Consistency | Consistency with time. | Correctness of ordered events or sequences, if reported. | dataset/dataset series/spatial object type | PS with objects that have a time value associated.

| Thematic Accuracy / ThematicClassificationCorrectness | Comparison of the classes assigned to features or their attributes to a universe of discourse. | miscalculationRate / This data quality measure indicates the number of incorrectly classified features in relation to the number of features that are supposed to be there. [Adapted from <<ISO19157>>] This is a RATE which is a ratio, and is expressed as a REAL number representing the rational fraction corresponding to the numerator and denominator of the ratio. For example, if there are 1 items that are classified incorrectly and there are 100 of the items in the dataset then the ratio is 1/100 and the reported rate = 0.01. | dataset/dataset series/spatial object type | All S-100 based PS.

| Aggregation Measures / AggregationMeasures | In a data Product Specification, several requirements are set up for a product to conform to the Specification. | DataProductSpecificationPassed / This data quality measure is a boolean indicating that all requirements in the referred data Product Specification are fulfilled. | dataset/dataset series/spatial object type | PS that a require a complete pass of all elements of a dataset/dataset series/spatial object types

| Aggregation Measures / AggregationMeasures | In a data Product Specification, several requirements are set up for a product to conform to the specification. | DataProductSpecificationFailRate / This data quality measure is a number indicating the number of data Product Specification requirements that are not fulfilled by the current product/dataset in relation to the total number of data Product Specification requirements. | dataset/dataset series/spatial object type | PS that a require a complete pass of all elements of a dataset/dataset series/spatial object types
